    <h4 style="color:#D8A800">How does pollination take place?<br>
      Pollination can take place in different ways, depending on the plant and the pollinating agents involved.

        <br>
        Pollination by wind:<br>
        Some plants have evolved to rely on the wind to carry their pollen from the male reproductive organs (anthers) to the female reproductive organs (stigmas). These plants often produce lightweight and dry pollen that can be easily carried by air currents. As the wind blows, it disperses the pollen, and if it reaches the stigma of a compatible flower, pollination occurs. This method doesn't require specific pollinators and is commonly observed in plants like grasses, conifers, and many trees.<br>
        <br>
        Pollination by insects:<br>
        Many plants have developed intricate relationships with insects as their primary pollinators. These plants have evolved attractive features such as vibrant colors, pleasant fragrances, and sweet nectar to entice insects like bees, butterflies, bumblebees, and flies. As insects move from flower to flower in search of nectar, pollen grains stick to their bodies. When they visit another flower of the same plant or a different plant of the same species, the pollen is transferred to the stigma, enabling pollination to occur. This method is prevalent in a wide range of flowering plants and plays a crucial role in sustaining diverse ecosystems.</h4>

    <h2 align="center" style="color:#D8A800">Direct Pollination</h2>
  </div>

<h4 style="color:black">
    Direct pollination is a type of pollination in which pollen from one flower is transferred directly to the stigma of the same flower or to another flower on the same plant. In this case, there are no external intermediaries, such as insects or the wind, involved in the pollen transfer process.<br>
    Self-Pollination:<br>
    In this type of pollination, pollen from one flower is transferred to the stigma of the same flower or to another flower on the same plant.<br>
    Cleistogamy:<br>
    Some plants have closed flowers that do not open and self-pollinate within themselves.</h4>
