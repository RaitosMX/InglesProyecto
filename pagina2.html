    <h4 style="color:#D8A800">What is the pollination?<br>
        <p>Pollination is a fundamental process that provides essential benefits. It consists of the transfer of pollen, which is a yellowish dust produced by the male organs of a flower, to the female organs of another flower. This action can occur in different ways: through the wind, the water, or, in most cases, with the help of pollinators such as bees, butterflies, birds, and bats. </p>
            
            <p>However, pollination not only benefits plants and their reproduction but also the environment as a whole. By promoting the genetic diversity of plant species, pollination contributes to the restoration and adaptability of ecosystems in the face of environmental challenges.</p>

    <p>Natural pollination:<br>
        Natural pollination consists of the transfer of pollen between the male and female organs of flowers without human intervention. That is, the pollen moves from the stamens to the stigma of the flowers, where it fertilizes their ovules, making possible the production of seeds and fruits.</p>
