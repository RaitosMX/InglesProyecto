    <h4 style="color:#D8A800"><p>Bees are excellent pollinators:<br>
      Plant reproduction requires the transfer of pollen from the anthers, or male parts of a flower, to the stigmas, that is, its female parts, either from the same plant or from other plants that are at a certain distance from each other. After thousands of years of evolution and adaptation to local environments, each plant species has specific requirements for the transport of its pollen; many of which depend on foraging insects that carry it from flower to flower.</p>
      
      <p>Many species of insects visit flowers to search for their nectar or pollen; and while they do so, they transport the granules that will contribute to pollination. Honey bees are highly effective pollinating insects: their bodies are covered with hairs that easily collect thousands of pollen granules when they move inside the flowers; they visit only one species of flower during each of their trips; each bee collects enough pollen for its own food and also for the needs of the colony. In a single day, a bee can visit thousands of flowers of the same species, collecting nectar and pollen and endlessly spreading pollen granules over all the flowers.</p>

    <h2 align="center" style="color:#D8A800">Cross pollination</h2>
  </div>

<h4 style="color:black">
  <p>Cross pollination:<br>
    Cross pollination is the transport of pollen from one plant to another. It is necessary when the male and female sexes are not found in the same plant, such as melons, or when they appear at different periods of the flowering of the same plant, such as avocados. Many varieties of fruit trees depend on cross pollination. These should be grown in such a way that the pollinating tree is close to the main planting.</p>
    
    <p>The production of hybrid seeds on a commercial scale creates a special need for insect cross-pollination: a large population of insects is needed for the exchange of pollen from the rows of male plants to the rows of female plants. Pollination can be as important to production as water or agricultural fertilizers. Despite the improvements achieved with the use of cultivars and irrigation, pollination may be the limiting factor in the quality and quantity of the harvest.</p>
    
    <p>The pollination conditions of the main crops of the temperate zones are well known. In countries with industrialized agriculture, the use of bees for pollination has increased enormously during the 20th century and has become an integral part of agricultural production. In tropical areas, research on pollination conditions in crops has been very limited.</p>
